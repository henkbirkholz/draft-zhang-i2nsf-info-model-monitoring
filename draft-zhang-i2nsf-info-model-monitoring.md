--- abstract

The Network Security Functions (NSF) NSF-facing interface exists
between the Service Provider's management system (or Security
Controller) and the NSFs to enforce the security policy provisioning and
network security status monitoring . This document focuses on the
monitoring part of it and proposes the information model for it.

# Introduction

According to {{-i2nsf-framework}}, the interface
provided by a NSF (e.g., FW, IPS, Anti-DDOS, or Anti-Virus) to
administrative entities (e.g., NMS, security controller) for configuring
security function in the NSF and monitoring the NSF is referred to as a
'I2NSF customer-facing interface'. The monitoring part of it is meant to
monitor the NSF e.g. events, alerts, alarms, logs, counters. The
monitoring of the NSF plays a very important role in the overall
security framework if done in a timely and comprehensive way. The
monitoring information generated by a NSF could very well be an early
indication of malicious activity, or anomalous behavior, or a potential
sign of denial of service attacks.

This draft proposes a comprehensive NSF monitoring information model
that provide visibility into NSFs. This document will not go into the
design details of NSF-facing interface. Instead, this draft is focused
on specifying the information that a NSF needs to provide in the
monitoring part of the NSF-facing interface, as well as its information
model. Besides, {{-i2nsf-capabilities}} specifies the
information model for the security policy provisioning part of the
NSF-facing interface.

# Use cases for NSF Monitoring Data

As mentioned earlier, monitoring plays a very critical role in the
overall security framework. The monitoring of the NSF provides very
valuable information to the security controller in maintaining the
provisioned security posture. Besides this, there are various other
reasons to monitor the NSFs as listed below:

* The security administrator could configure a policy that is
  triggered on a specific event happened in the NSF or the network.
  The security controller would monitor for the specified event and
  once it happens, it configures additional security functions as per
  the policy.

* The events triggered by NSFs as a result of security policy
  violation could be used by SIEM to detect any suspicious
  activity.

* The events and activity logs from NSFs could be used to build
  advanced analytics such as behavior and predictive to improve the
  security posture.

* The security controller could use events from the NSF for
  achieving high availability. It could take corrective actions such
  as restarting a failed NSF, horizontally scaling the NSF etc.

* The events and activity logs from the NSF could aid in debugging
  and root cause analysis of an operational issue.

* The activity logs from the NSF could be used to build historical
  data for operational and business reasons.



# Classification of NSF Monitoring Data

In order to maintain a strong security posture, it is not only
necessary to configure NSF security policies but also to continuously
monitor NSF by consuming acquirable monitoring data. This enables
security admins to assess what is happening in the network timely. It is
not possible to block all the internal and external threats based on
static security posture but requires a very dynamic posture with
constant visibility. This draft defines a set of information elements
(and their scope) that can be acquired from NSF and can be used as
monitoring data. In essence, these types of monitoring data can be
leveraged to support constant visibility on multiple levels of
granularity and can be consumed by corresponding functions. The types of
monitoring data as ordered below increase in expressiveness by
incorporating more information to the semantics of the monitoring data.
There are two categories of monitoring data. Information that is
produced and emitted by an NSF automatically (published data) and
information that is produced and retained by the NSF and has to be
collected in intervals (retained data):

Published Data:

* Events: the most generic type of monitoring data that can be
  emitted by an NSF. An event is defined in [RFC3877] as
  something that happens which may be of interest. A fault, a
  change in status, crossing a threshold, or an external input to the
  system, for example. In the context of the I2NSF IMM, an event is a
  representation of a change of state, configuration, or composition
  of an NSF or an entity (e.g. an endpoint) or an activity (e.g. a PDU
  flow) that can be observed by the NSF and can be interpreted as a
  change of state or behavior by the NSF. An event can be created
  without the use of an I2NSF Condition (declarative guidance)
  available to the NSF. In the context of I2NSF, in some cases an
  event can trigger low level I2NSF actions (which constitutes an
  implicit escalation to alert via primate assessment).

* Alert: an event that is annotated with a criticality assessment
  due to non-compliance with I2NSF conditions (declarative guidance)
  available to an I2NSF Consumer via I2NSF Actions. The Intrusion
  Detection Message Exchange Format [RFC4765] defines a representation
  that systems can use to report alerts about events that they
  deem suspicious and also associates a severity (an
  estimate of the relative severity of the event) with the
  corresponding alert. In the context of the I2NSF IMM, an alert is
  derived from events that express changes indicating not to conform
  with declarative guidance (e.g. an exceeded threshold of a value or
  a pattern or signature found in a PDU stream  typically an
  I2NSF condition) or due to imperative guidance (e.g. correlation
  rules applied to streams of multiple events over time or a
  black-list content of an event matches  typically an I2NSF
  Policy Rule). An alert is created by an I2NSF Producer with respect
  to I2NSF conditions (declarative guidance) or imperative guidance
  available to the I2NSF Producer. An alert does not indicate an
  immediate impact on operations and are not time-sensitive (but can
  be escalated to an alarm nevertheless due to persistence via an
  I2NSF Policy Rule).

* Alarms: an alarm that is annotated with the assertion of: 1.)
  having immediate impact on operations, or 2.) a persistence that in
  non-compliant in respect to I2NSF conditions (declarative guidance),
  or 3.) a correlation result produced by a I2NSF Service in respect
  to the result of I2NSF Policy Rules that process alerts. Alarms are
  time-sensitive and must be reported to the security admin as soon as
  possible. By processing alarms, the administrator can rapidly locate
  the root-cause of faults and rapidly deal with the faults to ensure
  normal operation of the NSFs and avoid NSFs going into unknown state
  or potentially exposing security vulnerabilities. An analyst can
  manage the NSF with via I2NSF Policy Rules. The intend of alarms is
  to highlight only critical information and to avoid continuous
  combing through large amount alerts (or even events) by
  analysts.


Retained Data:

* Logs: Logs are information generated by NSF about its operational
  and informational data, or various events such as user activities,
  network/traffic status and network activity, etc. Logs are important
  for debugging, auditing and security forensic. Unlike events, logs
  do not require an immediate attention from an analyst but may be
  useful for visibility and retroactive cyber forensic. Hence, logs
  usually include less structures but potentially more detailed
  information in regard to events. For example, the NSF could generate
  a log when due to an I2NSF Policy Rule. Logs can be continuously
  processed by I2NSF Agent that act as I2NSF Producer and emit events
  via function specifically tailored to a type of log.

* Counters: A specific representation of identical state changes
  that potentially occur in high frequency. Examples include network
  interface counters (packets, bytes), drop, error counters etc.
  Counters are useful in debugging and visibility into operational
  behavior of the NSF. An I2NSF Agent that observes the progress of
  counters can act as an I2NSF Producer and emit Events in respect to
  I2NSF Policy Rules.



# Exporting NSF Monitoring Data

As per the use cases of NSF monitoring data, the data need to be sent
to various consumers based on the needs and requirements. There are
multiple things to be considered for exporting this data to needed
parties as listed below:

* Pull-Push model: A set of data could be pushed by a NSF to the
  needed party or pulled by the needed party from a NSF. A specific
  data might need both the models at the same time if there are
  multiple consumers with varying requirements. It really depends upon
  the need and its usages to the consumer. In general, any alarm is
  considered to be of great importance and must be sent immediately
  for any meaningful action so it should be sent using push model but
  logs are not as critical so could be pulled by the consumer. The
  I2NSF does not mandate a specific scheme for each data set, it is up
  to each implementation.

* Export frequency: The monitoring data could be sent immediately
  upon generation by a NSF to interested parties or pushed
  periodically. The frequency of exporting the data depends upon its
  size and timely usefulness. It is out of the scope of I2NSF and left
  to each NSF implementation.

* Authentication: There may be a need for authentication between
  monitoring data producer (NSF) and consumer to ensure that critical
  information does not fall into wrong hands. This may be necessary if
  the NSF directly export data to the consumer outside its admin
  boundary. The I2NSF does not mandate when and how specific
  authentication must be done.

* Subscription method: In order for the consumer to pull the data
  from NSF or for NSF to push the data to a consumer, there must be a
  mechanism for consumer to subscribe to the NSF data it is interested
  in. There are few open source method available and it is up to each
  implementation to decide the right one.

* Data transfer mode: The data could be pushed by NSF using a
  connection-less model that does require a persistent connection or
  streamed over a persistent connection. It depends upon the
  requirement of the consumer and the nature of data. A particular set
  of data can use either or both the mode based on implementation.

* Transport method: There are lot of transport mechanism such as
  IP, UDP, TCP. There are also open source implementations for
  specific set of data such as systems counter. The I2NSF does not
  mandate any specific method for a given data set, it is up to each
  implementation.



# Basic Information Model for All Monitoring Data

As explained in the above section, there is a wealth of data
available from the NSF that can be monitored. Firstly, there must be
some general information with each monitoring message sent from an NSF
that helps consumer in identifying meta data with that message, which
are listed as below:



* message_version: Indicate the version of the data format and is a
  two-digit decimal numeral starting from 01

* message_type: Event, Alert, Alarm, Log, Counter, etc

* time_stamp: Indicate the time when the message is generated

* vendor_name: The name of the NSF vendor

* NSF_name: The name (or IP) of the NSF generating the message

* Module_name: The module name outputting the message

* Severity: Indicates the level of the logs. There are total eight
  levels, from 0 to 7. The smaller the numeral is, the higher the
  severity is.



# Extended Information Model for Monitoring Data

This section covers the additional information associated with the
system messages. The extended information model is only for the
structured data such as alarm. Any unstructured data is specified with
basic information model only.

\[Editors' note]: This section remains the same as -02 version,
although the classification of the monitoring data has been changed from
-02 version. The new inconsistency will be addressed in next verion.

### Policy Hit Counters

Policy Hit Counters record the security policy that traffic
matches and its hit count. It can check if policy configurations are
correct.



* src_zone: Source security zone of traffic

* dst_zone: Destination security zone of traffic

* src_region: Source region of the traffic

* dst_region: Destination region of the traffic

* src_ip: Source IP address of traffic

* src_user: User who generates traffic

* dst_ip: Destination IP address of traffic

* src_port: Source port of traffic

* dst_port: Destination port of traffic

* protocol: Protocol type of traffic

* app: Application type of traffic

* policy_id: Security policy id that traffic matches

* policy_name: Security policy name that traffic matches

* hit_times: The hit times that the security policy matches the
  specified traffic.

# Security Considerations {#Security}

The monitoring information of NSF should be protected by the secure
communication channel, to ensure its confidentiality and integrity. In
another side, the NSF and security controller can all be faked, which
lead to undesireable results, i.e., leakage of NSF's important
operational information, faked NSF sending false information to mislead
security controller. The mutual authentication is essential to protected
against this kind of attack. The current mainstream security
technologies (i.e., TLS, DTLS, IPSEC, X.509 PKI) can be employed
approriately to provide the above security functions.

In addition, to defend against the DDoS attack caused by a lot of
NSFs sending massive monitoring information to the security controller,
the rate limiting or similar mechanisms should be considered in NSF and
security controller, whether in advance or just in the process of DDoS
attack.
